# MeTHODICAL

MeTHODICAL is a Multiple Attribute Decision Mechanism developed in the context of a PhD seeking to optimize the use of multiple interfaces in multihomed nodes, that is nodes with multiple interfaces, with or without multiple Radio Access Technologies (RATs).

## Where it is been used ?

MeTHODICAL has been employed in several works:
1. To optimize resource allocation in Fog and edge computing paradigms:
> Marcelo Araújo et al. "CMFog: Proactive Content Migration Using Markov Chain and MADM in Fog Computing", UCC 2020

1.  To optmimize the caching in ICN:
>Andre Gomes and Bruno Sousa et al. "Edge Caching with Mobility Prediction in Virtualized LTE Mobile Networks". In: Future Generation Computer Systems (2016). doi: 10.1016/j.future.2016.06.022

1. To optimize the quality of applications:
> Bruno Sousa, et al. "EVA: Enhancing VoIP Applications". In: Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), 2013 IEEE. doi: 10.1109/GLOCOM.2013.6831256

  > Bruno Sousa, et al. "Enhancing Path Selection in Multihomed Nodes". In: Mobile Networks and Management. Vol. 125. Springer. doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-04277-0_6

1. To optimize the resilience in applications:
> Bruno Sousa, et al. "Optimizing quality of resilience in the cloud". In: Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), 2014 IEEE. doi: 10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7036961


## Why in R project ?

During the PhD almost all the work was evaluated in R, along with the scripts to produce graphics, comparing results.



## Should I use it ?

Honestly, it depends on the nature of your problem. But if you can formulate it with multiple attribute either with benefits and costs criteria, probably you can give it a try.

If you use it, be kind to refer the following paper, as well:

Thanks and let me know if it has been useful (drop me an email).
